# hello-world

Hello, 

My name is Matthew and I'm a wannnabe programmer learning the ropes. I'm using GitHub as a platform to expand my knowledge and showcase my development (hopefully!). I'm currently a student at the University of North Texas studying computer engineering with an emphasis in Network and Communications Systems. That's all for now!
